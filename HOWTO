DGP-DEC is a base code for digital geometry processing (DGP) applications. It provides
a simple and practical interface for typical geometry operations based on the framework
of Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC). 

To develop your own application, you have to edit at least two files:
1) Add code for your application in include/Application.h 
2) Instantiate class Application inside Viewer::mProcess() in src/Viewer.cpp
