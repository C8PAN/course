DGP-DEC is a framework for writing digital geometry processing (DGP) applications. 
It provides a simple and practical interface for typical geometry operations based 
on Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC). 
It also provides wrappers to sparse linear system solvers as well as basic visuali-
zation and interaction modes via GLSL and GLUT.

Mouse control: 
* left click: rotate
* right click: show menu
* shift + left click: pick/unpick vertex

To develop your own application:
1) Add code for your application in include/Application.h.
2) Call Application inside Viewer::mProcess() in src/Viewer.cpp.
3) Customize other classes according to the application.
